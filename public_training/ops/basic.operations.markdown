{
   "props" : {
      "postcommit" : [],
      "dw" : "quorum",

      "pw" : 0,
      "n_val" : 3,
      "w" : "quorum",
      "r" : "quorum"
   }
}
```

^ Bucket properties can be retrieved via HTTP or Protocol Buffers

---

# Bucket Properties (1.4)

Default bucket properties can be specified in the app.config file:

```
{default_bucket_props, [{n_val,5},{allow_mult,true}]}
```

---

# Bucket Properties (2.x)

Default bucket properties can be specified in the riak.conf file:

```
buckets.default.allow_mult = false
buckets.default.basic_quorum = false
buckets.default.dw = quorum
buckets.default.last_write_wins = false
buckets.default.merge_strategy = 1
buckets.default.n_val = 3
buckets.default.notfound_ok = true
buckets.default.pr = 0
buckets.default.pw = 0
buckets.default.r = quorum
buckets.default.rw = quorum
buckets.default.w = quorum
```

---

# Bucket Properties (2.x) (continued)

Or using "bucket types"...

```
riak-admin bucket-type <action>
```

*   list                
*   status <type>      
*   activate <type>   
*   create <type> <json> 
*   update <type> <json> 

---

Bucket properties can be overridden via PB or HTTP interface:

```
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json"\
-d '{"props":{"allow_mult":true}}'\
http://127.0.0.1:8098/buckets/test/props
```

# Tuneable Consistency


R / W / DW / RW

^for an operation to be considered successfull, the number of replicas which must reply
^DW number of replicas which must reply to a write request indicating the write was committed to durable storage 
^RW quorum for both operations (get and put)

---

# Tuneable Consistency


PR / PW 

^ The number of primary, non-fallback replicas that must reply to a read request.

---

# Tuneable Consistency


`return_body`
`return_head`


^ when performing PUT operations, whether to reply with the created object 

---

# Tuneable Consistency


`notfound_ok`
`basic_quorum`

^Whether not-founds will invoke the "basic quorum" optimization. 
^This setting will short-circuit fetches where the majority of replicas report that the key is not found. Only used when `notfound_ok` is set to false.
^Whether not-founds will count toward a quorum of reads.

---

# What are Secondary Indexes?

* Non-primary key lookups
* Defined as object metadata
* Requires sorted backend: Memory or LevelDB
* Document-based partitioning

---

# Direct key access vs Coverage Query


![inline](./basic.operations//coverage-vs-normal-query.png)


^explain the costs involved in carrying out a coverage query

---

# What Can Be Indexed?

* Indexes are metadata, not tied to object data
* Binary indexes (suffixed `_bin`)
* Integer indexes (suffixed `_int`)

---

# Querying Secondary Indexes

* Only one index can be queried
* Exact match query
* Range query
* Supports pagination
* Returns key, optionally index value

---

# Special Indexes

* $key - Key name
* $bucket - Bucket name

---

# User Metadata

* Tags (Key-Value string pairs) that can be associated with any object.
* For compatibility with the HTTP interface, user metadata keys should be prefixed with ‘X-Riak-Meta-’.

---

# Listing Keys and Buckets

* *Very* expensive operations, especially bucket listing
* *Do not* use in production
* Always stream data
* Key listing uses secondary indexes if bucket allows

---
