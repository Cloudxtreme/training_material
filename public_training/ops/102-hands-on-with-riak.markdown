* Basic Commands
* Rolling Restarts
* Upgrading Riak

---

# Files and locations (2.0)
## configuration

```
/etc/riak
    -|riak.conf
    -|advanced.config
```

```
/var/lib/riak
    -|generated.configs
```

---

# Files and locations (legacy)
## configuration

```
/etc/riak
    -|app.config
    -|vm.args
```

---

# vm.args (legacy)

* `vm.args`
* `Erlang -name and -setcookie`
* `ERL_MAX_PORTS`
* `ERL_MAX_ETS_TABLES`
* `+zdbbl`

^ The vm.args file is used to configure the Erlang virtual machine. 
^ Examples of the types of configuration are provided.  
^ Review vm.args file with the group and point to http://www.erlang.org/documentation/doc-5.9.1/doc/ for more info on each tuning. 
^ -name: Makes the Erlang runtime system into a distributed node. This flag invokes all network servers necessary for a node to become distributed. Should be “something”@IP or “something”@FQDN 
^ -setcookie: A layer of security to prevent riak nodes being accidentally added to the wrong cluster 
^ ERL_MAX_PORTS = maximum number of erlang ports (like number of open files) 
^ ERL_MAX_ETS_TABLES = maximum number of ETS tables allowed 
^ +zdbbl - Set the distribution buffer busy limit (dist_buf_busy_limit) in kilobytes. 
^ Valid range is 1-2097151. Default is 1024. 

--- 

# vm.args (2.x)

Prefix arbitrary flags like so:

```
echo "erlang.distribution.net_ticktime=15" >> ./dev1/etc/riak.conf
```

# Basic Commands


```
/usr/sbin/riak

Usage: riak «command»
where «command» is one of the following:
    { help | start | stop | restart | ping | console | attach
      attach-direct | ertspath | chkconfig | escript | version | getpid
      top [-interval N] [-sort { reductions | memory | msg_q }] [-lines N] } |
      config { generate | effective | describe VARIABLE } [-l debug]

Run `riak help` for more detailed information.
```

---

# riak start

^Starts the riak node in the background. If the node is already started, you will get the message "Node is already running!" If the node is not already running, no output will be given.

---

# riak stop

^ Stops the running riak node. Prints "ok" when successful.  
^ When the node is already stopped or not responding, prints:
^ "Node 'riak@192.168.84.134' not responding to pings."

---

# riak restart

^ Stops and then starts the running riak node. Prints “ok" when successful.  When the node is already stopped or not responding, prints: "Node 'riak@192.168.84.134' not responding to pings."

---

# riak console
^ Starts the riak node in the foreground, giving access to the Erlang shell and runtime messages. Prints "Node is already running - use 'riak attach' instead" when the node is running in the background.

---

# DIAGNOSTIC COMMANDS

---

# riak ping
^ Checks that the riak node is running. Prints "pong" when
^ successful.  When the node is stopped or not responding, prints:
^ "Node 'riak@192.168.84.134' not responding to pings."

---

# riak top [-interval N] [-sort {reductions | memory | msg_q }] [-lines N]
^ Prints performance information about the Erlang Virtual Machine similar
^ to the information provided by the `top` command.
^ -interval N
^ specifies an interval upon which the statistics are collected.
^ -sort { reductions | memory | msg_q }
^ Sorts the output of the command by Reduction Count, Memory
^ Utilization, or Message Queue size
^ -lines N
^ Controls the number of processes displayed in the output

---

# riak attach
^ Attaches to the console of a riak node running in the background
^ using an Erlang remote shell, giving access to the Erlang shell and
^ runtime messages. Prints "Node is not running!" when the node cannot
^ be reached. Exit `riak attach` by pressing Ctrl-C twice.

---

# riak attach-direct

^ Attaches to the console of a riak node running in the background
^ using a directly connected FIFO, giving access to the Erlang shell
^ and runtime messages. Prints "Node is not running!" when the node
^ cannot be reached. Exit `riak attach-direct` by pressing Ctrl-D.

---

# riak chkconfig

^ Confirms whether the riak.conf and advanced.config is
^ valid.
^
^ For applications configured with cuttlefish, this includes a call
^ to `config generate` also.

---

# riak config { generate | effective | describe VARIABLE } [-l debug]

^        prints configuration information for applications configured with
^        cuttlefish enabled. `-l debug` outputs more information for
^        troubleshooting.

---

# riak config generate
^            generates the app.config and vm.args files from the .conf file.
^            This is effectively what happens before start, but you'll need
^            to use `config generate -l debug` to see the cuttlefish debug
^           output.

---

# riak config effective
^            prints out the effective configuration in cuttlefish syntax
^            including defaults not specified in the .conf file. This is
^            for 'start-time' configuration only.

---

#riak config describe VARIABLE
^            for a given setting, prints any documentation and other useful
^            information, such as affected location in app.config, datatype
^            of the value, default value, and effective value.

---

# SCRIPTING COMMANDS

---

# riak ertspath
^        Outputs the path to the riak Erlang runtime environment

---

# riak escript


^        Provides a means to call the `escript` application within the riak
^        Erlang runtime environment

---

# riak version
^        Outputs the riak version identifier

---

# riak getpid

^        Outputs the process identifier for a currently running instance of
^        riak.

---

# Basic administrative commands

```
[root@localhost ~]# riak-admin
Usage: riak-admin { 
          cluster | join | leave | backup | restore | test | 
          reip | js-reload | erl-reload | wait-for-service | 
          ringready | transfers | force-remove | down |
          cluster-info | member-status | ring-status | vnode-status |
          aae-status | diag | stat | status | transfer-limit |
          top [-interval N] [-sort reductions|memory|msg_q] [-lines N] |
          reformat-indexes  | downgrade-objects | security | 
          bucket-type | repair-2i | search | services |
          ensemble-status | handoff | set | show | describe }
