# Basic Commands


```
/usr/sbin/riak

Usage: riak «command»
where «command» is one of the following:
    { help | start | stop | restart | ping | console | attach
      attach-direct | ertspath | chkconfig | escript | version | getpid
      top [-interval N] [-sort { reductions | memory | msg_q }] [-lines N] } |
      config { generate | effective | describe VARIABLE } [-l debug]

Run `riak help` for more detailed information.
```

---

# riak start

^Starts the riak node in the background. If the node is already started, you will get the message "Node is already running!" If the node is not already running, no output will be given.

---

# riak stop

^ Stops the running riak node. Prints "ok" when successful.  
^ When the node is already stopped or not responding, prints:
^ "Node 'riak@192.168.84.134' not responding to pings."

---

# riak restart

^ Stops and then starts the running riak node. Prints “ok" when successful.  When the node is already stopped or not responding, prints: "Node 'riak@192.168.84.134' not responding to pings."

---

# riak console
^ Starts the riak node in the foreground, giving access to the Erlang shell and runtime messages. Prints "Node is already running - use 'riak attach' instead" when the node is running in the background.

---

# DIAGNOSTIC COMMANDS

---

# riak ping
^ Checks that the riak node is running. Prints "pong" when
^ successful.  When the node is stopped or not responding, prints:
^ "Node 'riak@192.168.84.134' not responding to pings."

---

# riak top [-interval N] [-sort {reductions | memory | msg_q }] [-lines N]
^ Prints performance information about the Erlang Virtual Machine similar
^ to the information provided by the `top` command.
^ -interval N
^ specifies an interval upon which the statistics are collected.
^ -sort { reductions | memory | msg_q }
^ Sorts the output of the command by Reduction Count, Memory
^ Utilization, or Message Queue size
^ -lines N
^ Controls the number of processes displayed in the output

---

# riak attach
^ Attaches to the console of a riak node running in the background
^ using an Erlang remote shell, giving access to the Erlang shell and
^ runtime messages. Prints "Node is not running!" when the node cannot
^ be reached. Exit `riak attach` by pressing Ctrl-C twice.

---

# riak attach-direct

^ Attaches to the console of a riak node running in the background
^ using a directly connected FIFO, giving access to the Erlang shell
^ and runtime messages. Prints "Node is not running!" when the node
^ cannot be reached. Exit `riak attach-direct` by pressing Ctrl-D.

---

# riak chkconfig

^ Confirms whether the riak.conf and advanced.config is
^ valid.
^
^ For applications configured with cuttlefish, this includes a call
^ to `config generate` also.

---

# riak config { generate | effective | describe VARIABLE } [-l debug]

^        prints configuration information for applications configured with
^        cuttlefish enabled. `-l debug` outputs more information for
^        troubleshooting.

---

# riak config generate
^            generates the app.config and vm.args files from the .conf file.
^            This is effectively what happens before start, but you'll need
^            to use `config generate -l debug` to see the cuttlefish debug
^           output.

---

# riak config effective
^            prints out the effective configuration in cuttlefish syntax
^            including defaults not specified in the .conf file. This is
^            for 'start-time' configuration only.

---

#riak config describe VARIABLE
^            for a given setting, prints any documentation and other useful
^            information, such as affected location in app.config, datatype
^            of the value, default value, and effective value.

---

# SCRIPTING COMMANDS

---

# riak ertspath
^        Outputs the path to the riak Erlang runtime environment

---

# riak escript


^        Provides a means to call the `escript` application within the riak
^        Erlang runtime environment

---

# riak version
^        Outputs the riak version identifier

---

# riak getpid

^        Outputs the process identifier for a currently running instance of
^        riak.

---

# Basic administrative commands

# Common Error Messages
erlang

* long_gc
* busy_dist_port
* Too many db tables
* {error, ePOSIXERROR}

^Long_gc: warning that garbage collection is taking too long.  An indication that your systems need more memory 
^Busy_dist_port: distributed Erlang was unable to open a connection to another node.  
^Usually indicates you need to increase +zdbbl in /etc/riak/vm.args 
^Too many db tables: Erlang was unable to allocate an ETS table.  Most often encountered when using Riak Search.  Increase ERL_MAX_ETS_TABLES in /etc/riak/vm.args. 
^{error, e___}: indicates the Erlang VM encountered a POSIX error when interacting with the OS.   
^Examples: enoent (no such file or directory) or emfile (exceeded allowed file descriptors)
 

---

# Common Error Messages

* Bitcask
* Failed to merge
* LevelDB
* Compaction error

^Failed to merge: one of your Bitcask data files is likely corrupted.  
^ Most common solution is to truncate the file 
^Compaction error: one of your LevelDB SST files is corrupt. 
^The corrupt partition will need to have leveled repair run on it, and should have KV repair run to ensure that there is no replica loss.

```

^ Lets examine these settings one at a time

---


# `tcp_max_syn_backlog`

* Keeps more SYN requests in memory.  

* Helps moderate the effect of a large number of connections at peak times. 

---

# `net.core.somaxconn`

* Increases the max TCP sockets in a LISTEN state 

---

# `tcp_timestamps` 

* We’ve seen performance benefits while disabling this option on networks less than 10GbE.

^ This should be enabled on 10GbE networks. 

---

# `tcp_sack` 

* Enables selective ACKs.  
* Helps to reduce the amount of data sent during retransmits. 

---

# `tcp_window_scaling`

* Enables window scaling.  
* Reduces bandwidth loss on high bandwidth connections. 

---

# `tcp_fin_timeout` 

* How long to keep sockets in the `FIN_WAIT_2` status.  
* Default: 60.  
* Decreasing helps reap closed connections faster. 

---

# `tcp_keepalive_intvl`

* The interval between sending keepalive probes.  
* Default: 75.  
* Decreasing allows failed connections to be closed sooner. 

---

# `tcp_tw_reuse`

Allow reusing sockets in `TIME_WAIT` state for new connections

---

# Mount Options

* EXT4: noatime, nodirtime, barrier = 0, data=writeback
* XFS: noatime, nodirtime, nobarrier, logbufs=8, logbsize=32k, allocsize=2M

^Both Riak backends are append-only and can tolerate end of file corruption.  
^ It is preferable to optimize for long-term throughput than for crash-time consistency. 
^ Riak does not require atime, disable it 
^ Barriers ensure proper write ordering by forcing a flush to media for any given commit before the next flush may begin.  
^ Not necessary when using modern RAID controllers, external storage, or for Riak in general. 
^ Data=writeback allows data to be flushed to disk AFTER its metadata is committed to the journal.  
^ This is an optimization that favors throughput over consistency. 
^ Logbufs specifies the number of in-memory log buffers. Increasing this value will generally improve performance at the cost of greater memory consumption 8 is the max 
^ Logbsize specifies the log buffer size for each log buffer. Default is 32k.  
^ Increasing this value will allow more file modifications to be kept in memory, improving performance Allocsize specifies how much space will be pre-allocated for files in order to reduce fragmentation 
 
---

# Disk IO Tuning

* `/sys/block/x/queue/scheduler`
* Use noop or deadline
* `/sys/block/x/queue/nr_requests`
* 1024

^ Scheduler defines the algorithm by which data is flushed to disk.      
^ Noop tends to work best with network-based file systems since they implement their own flush algorithm     
^ Deadline works best for direct attached storage     
^ The default scheduler is CFQ and tends to be _very_ bad for Riak performance 
^ `nr_requests` defines the depth of the scheduler queue.  Default is 128.  
^ Longer queues allow for more efficient ordering and increased probability of merging requests.

# Backups

---

# Backups

* Node Backups
* MDC Backup Clusters
* Data Export

---

# Node Backups

* Should be taken on a “cold” node
* Tools:
* filesystem snapshots
* rsync

^Snapshotting filesystems are recommended since there is an intrinsic indeterminism as you back up the cluster.   
^ This can be reduced by taking a rolling snapshot of the cluster and then backing up from the snapshots once the nodes are back running and taking data. 

---

# Node Backups

* /var/lib/riak
* any data directories outside of /var/lib/riak
* /etc/riak
* /usr/lib/riak/lib/basho-patches

---

# Restoring Node Backups

(with the same node name)

* Install Riak
* Restore the backed up files to the proper directories
* Start Riak
* Verify that the cluster sees the restored node using riak-admin member-status

---

# Restoring Node Backups

(with a new node name)

* Install Riak
* Restore the backed up files to the proper directories
* Update the riak.conf file to reflect the new node name
* Remove the contents of /var/lib/riak/ring
* Start Riak

---

# Restoring Node Backups

(with a new node name)

* Join the node to the cluster
* Mark the old node name ‘down’
* Use force-replace to transfer the ownership of the partitions on the old name to the new name
* Plan the changes to the cluster (verify that the expected changes will be made)
* Commit the changes (verify that the cluster sees the restored node using riak-admin member-status)

---

# MDC BACKUP CLusters

* With Riak Enterprise Edition, a backup cluster can be created
* Production cluster and backup cluster are kept in sync with MDC
* Replication is stopped, backup cluster is backed up in a rolling fashion
* Replication is restarted and a full-sync is initiated

* Memory
* Multi

---

# Bitcask

* Strengths
* Low, predictable latency
* Windowed merges
* Supports object expiration
* Weaknesses
* All keys must fit in memory

---

# LevelDB

* Strengths
* Supports Secondary Indexes (2i)
* Data Compression
* Not bounded by memory
* Weaknesses
* Latency increases with data volume

---

# Memory

* Strengths
* Supports Secondary Indexes (2i)
* Supports object expiration
* Everything is in memory
* Weaknesses
* Everything is in memory

---

# MULTI

* Multi backend enables the use of one or more different backend configurations
* Different configurations of same backend can be allowed.  For example, a non-expiring Bitcask backend paired with an expiring one
* Resource demands are multiplied over number of backend instances

# Tips and Tricks

### DO...

* Use DNS names for your nodes
* Use KV GET/PUT as much as possible
* Use the Protocol Buffer API
* Load test frequently
* Familiarize yourself with the output of riak-debug
* Perform Disaster Recovery Exercises

---

# Tips and Tricks

### DON’T...

* Use JavaScript MapReduce
* Use Bitcask expiration with AAE or Riak Search
* Use Broadcom network interfaces :(
