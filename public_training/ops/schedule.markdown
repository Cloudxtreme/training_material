^Welcome to Basho for this Riak Operations Training

^Introduce presenters.

---

# Practicalities

^Safety - Fire escapes, First Aid, Toilets, Refreshments, Smoking

^Wireless 

^Swag

^Questions/interruptions welcome -- this is the first public course so we'd really appreciate feedback (& will indeed ask for it at the end)

---

# Objectives

- Deploy and tune a Riak cluster
- Identify a monitoring strategy
- Identify and respond to common problem scenarios
- Set up backups and multi-datacenter replication

^Mention feedback again -- we'll ask if they felt we achieved these things

---

# Introductions

^Possible icebreaker: pair for 2 minutes, introduce your neighbour, something silly (favourite food or drink) and what they most want out of this training

^May need to adjust objectives to accommodate, so possibly re-show that slide
