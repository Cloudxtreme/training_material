# Backend config

* %% Riak KV config
*  {riak_kv, [
*             %% Storage_backend specifies the Erlang 
*             %% module defining the storage mechanism
*             %% that will be used on this node.
*             {storage_backend, riak_kv_bitcask_backend},

# Bitcask

* Developed by Basho Technologies
* A fast, append-only key-value store
* In memory key lookup table (key_dir)
* Closed files are immutable
* Merging cleans up old data
* Suitable for bounded data
* http://downloads.basho.com/papers/bitcask-intro.pdf

---

# Bitcask

* Strengths
* Low, predictable latency
* Configurable merging behaviour
* Object expiration (TTL)
* Weaknesses
* All keys must fit in memory

---

# Bitcask Tips

* Bitcask depends on filesystem caching
* Be aware of file handle limits
* Consider vnode count and max_file_size
* Purge stale entries with expiry
* Merge off-peak

---

# LevelDB

* Developed by Google
* Append-only
* Multiple levels of SSTable-like data structures
* Allows for more advanced querying (2i)
* Open Source (BSD License)
* Suitable for unbounded data or advanced querying
* eLevelDB is an Erlang application that encapsulates LevelDB

---

# LevelDB

* Strengths
* Supports secondary indexes
* Snappy compression
* Not bounded by memory
* Weaknesses
* Latency increases with data volume

^LevelDB uses Google Snappy data compression by default. This means more CPU usage but less disk space. The compression efficiency is especially good for text data: raw text, Base64, JSON, etc.

# LevelDB Tips

* Calculate suitable settings based on system specs
* Review Riak release notes when upgrading
* Memory management is being simplified in 2.0

---

# Memory

* Data is never persisted to disk
* Typically used for test databases e.g. unit tests
* Configurable memory footprint per node
* Configurable object expiry

---

# Memory

* Strengths
* Fast
* Useful for highly transient data
* Weaknesses
* Data durability

---

# Memory Tips

* Calculate memory requirements taking in to consideration node failure and other system requirements on memory

---

# Multi-backend

* Configure multiple backends for different types of data
* Configure the default storage engine
* Choose storage engine on per bucket basis
* No reason not to use it

---

# Multi-backend config

* {storage_backend, riak_kv_multi_backend},
* {multi_backend_default, <<"bitcask_be">>},
* {multi_backend, [
*                  {<<"bitcask_be">>, riak_kv_bitcask_backend, [
*                      {data_root, "/var/lib/riak/bitcask"}
*                  ]},
*                  {<<"leveldb_be">>, riak_kv_eleveldb_backend, [
*                      {data_root, "/var/lib/riak/leveldb"}
*                  ]},
*                  {<<"memory_be">>, riak_kv_memory_backend, [
*                      {max_memory, 512}, %% in megabytes
*                  ]}
* ]},

# General Storage Tips

* Increase number of file handles (ulimit)
* Avoid updating file metadata (noatime)
* Tune data mount for partition format
* Tune device scheduler for disk type
