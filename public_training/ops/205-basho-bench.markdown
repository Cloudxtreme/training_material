# Basho Bench

# performance and stress testing

---

# Basho Bench

![left fit](./design-assets/Bashomen/png/diagnose.png)

* A simple, yet powerful tool created to conduct reliable performance & stress tests, accompanied by
* Beautiful R graphs.



---

# Why?

* Minimise surprises during deployment
* Test expected / peak load
* Identify failure points early
* "You can expect what you inspect."

---

# What?

* Basho Bench focuses on 2 metrics:
* Throughput: number of operations performed in a timeframe, captured in aggregate across all operation types
* Latency: time to complete single operations, captured in quantiles per-operation

---

# How?

* Setup the Riak (EE) cluster
* Install Basho Bench on a dedicated server
* Plan & Configure a (BB) test scenario
* Run Basho Bench against the Riak cluster
* Generate Graphs & Evaluate Results
* GOTO 3

# Installing

---

# Erlang

```bash
wget http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_R15B01.tar.gz
tar zxvf otp_src_R15B01.tar.gz
cd otp_src_R15B01
./configure && make && sudo make install
```

---

# Basho Bench

```bash
git clone git://github.com/basho/basho_bench.git
cd basho_bench
make all
```

---

# R

```
wget http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/R-3.0.2.tar.gz
cd R-3.0.2
./configure && make && sudo make install
```

---

# Configuring 1/2

* Start from one of the example configurations (under ./example/) and adjust it according to your needs
* Define rate limit, concurrency, duration, operations (PUT/GET/DELETE/2i/MR), key/value generator

---

# Configuring 2/2

* Run at max, i.e.: as quickly as possible: `{mode, max}`
* Run 15 operations per second per worker: `{mode, {rate, 15}}`
* Run 10 concurrent processes: `{concurrent, 10}`
* Run the test for one hour: `{duration, 60}`
* Run 80% GETs, 20% PUTs: `{operations, [{get, 4}, {put, 1}]}`
* Generate a fixed size, random binary of 512 bytes:
`{value_generator, {fixed_bin, 512}}`
* Use a randomly selected integer between 1 and 10,000: 
`{key_generator, {uniform_int, 10000}}`
