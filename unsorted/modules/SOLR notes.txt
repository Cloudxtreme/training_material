Open source - Apache v2
Write It Like Riak, Query It Like Solr
Distributed Solr sits on top of each Riak node, with Yokozuna (Riak Search) in between
Connect a bucket (or bucket type) to a Solr index, then PUT objects into Riak as normal and within a second they will appear in the Solr query
Schemas are needed to tell Solr what "type" each field in documents are, so that they can be indexed properly
Default or custom schemas
Extractors allow Riak objects to be treated as Solr documents
Built-in extractors for standard types like plaintext, JSON, XML
Or write your own custom extractors
Language-specific analyzers, tokenizers, filters
Majority of distributed Solr's features
Automatic index repair via Riak's AAE
Indexes can be manually deleted
Results can be piped to Riak MapReduce
Security: limit admin of schemas or indexes by user; limit querying by index

YOKOZUNA
Listens for KV changes and updates Solr indexes
Translate queries so as not to overlap multiple replicas
Coverage plan calculation - async update every few seconds
Disseminate admin commands e.g. index creation
Monitor the Solr instance (in fact, monitoring is bi-directional)
